# React Chat with AI

This is a simple react act for talking to Ollama since I got tired of using the commandline.


## Installation
install Node

**Windows**
download and install from node official website.
[https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

**OS X**
If you have Homebrew installed:

`brew install node`

If not you can download it from the official website.

[https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/jasonmcalpin/react-chat-with-ai.git`

go into the folder and run 

`npm install`

You are now ready to run the app. 

## Running the app

The usual commands are available:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
